# BMI-Calculator
BMI Calculator to calculate BMI using nodejs. 
Going to be make our code run server side.
So when our web site makes a request to our server, it's going to execute the code and only deliver the outcome back to the user, so the user doesn't get to see any of the code and logic of our calculator.
It's all done on our server.
